## About Project  
  
The game attempts to recapture the driving feel of old Rockstar games like Death Rally or GTA1&2 while utilizing a modern newtonian physics engine.  
  
The tournament base, which gives an otherwise arcade game more serious feeling, is to be built upon to expand both gameplay (eg. choice of weapons) and atmosphere (storytelling).
